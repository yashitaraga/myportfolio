<h1>Multifactorial Analysis of Baldness Prevalence</h1>
<p><strong>Academic Project | Indiana University | January 2024 â€“ April 2024</strong></p>
<p>By: Yashita Raga Saranam and Group 9 Members</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This project investigates the various genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors contributing to baldness. Using a dataset of 999 individuals from Kaggle, we analyzed 12 variables to identify key risk contributors to hair loss using R for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Determine whether factors like stress, hormones, smoking, and nutrition have a significant impact on baldness.</li>
  <li>Apply Chi-square testing and multiple logistic regression models for statistical analysis.</li>
  <li>Use feature selection and interaction terms to refine model accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Initial tests found no significant individual predictors; however, after feature selection, medical conditions such as thyroid problems showed strong association with baldness.</li>
  <li>Smoking, especially when combined with eczema, had a significant interaction effect contributing to hair loss.</li>
  <li>The final model rejected the null hypothesis, confirming that at least one factor among the evaluated variables does influence baldness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>R (Data Cleaning, Logistic Regression, Visualization)</li>
  <li>Chi-square Tests, One-hot Encoding, Q-Q Plots, Log Transformations</li>
</ul>
